# AeroScript
A domain-specific language for maneuvering a drone, built following some very eccentric instructions. Not applicable to any drones yet, as it has no way of interfacing with them.

See report.md for information on how it was implemented and why many parts of it make no sense.

## How to use
1. Build with Gradle.
2. Write your AeroScript code in a file (see example files for reference).
3. Run the file through AeroScript.
